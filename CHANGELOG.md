# Changelog

## [0.1.4]
### Fixed
 - Fixed the bug of disconnections between head and tail while plotting a disclination loops
 - Fixed the bug of modification of ```colors``` and ```opacity``` for the figure.


## [0.1.3]
### Added
 - Added ```n_color_immerse()``` to color directors with immersion from RP^2 to R^3 (boys's surface).
 - Added ```is_norm``` flag into ```Check_Sn``` to normalized directors.
### Changed
 - Replaced ```QField``` type alias in ```datatypes.py``` with a more explicit ```Union[QField5, QField9]``` for clearer type annotations.
 - Replaced ```colors``` from np.ndarray to a callable functions or a uniform value to color directors in ```PlotnPlane```. Since directors are generated by ```PlotPlaneGrid```, it is probably impossible to manually set color for each director. Set the default function as ```n_color_immerse()```.
  - Performed the similar modification to ```opacity```

## [0.1.2]
### Added
 - Added ```PlotPlaneGrid``` for creating a grid plane to visualize quantities.
 - Added ```PlotnPlane``` for visualizing director fields on a plane.

## [0.1.1]
### Added
 - Added ```as_Vect3D()``` and ```as_ColorRGB()``` in ```datatypes.py``` to validate input data.
 - Added smoothing functionality for both ends of disclination lines of type ```cross``` types.

 ### Fixed
- Fixed bugs in `as_QField5()` and `as_QField9()`.

## [0.1.0] 2025-08-13
 - Initial release.
