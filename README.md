# Nematics3D

Tools for 3D nematic field analysis and visualization.


Nematics3D provides a Python interface for working with 3D nematic fields. It supports building `QFieldObject` instances from tensor or director-based inputs, detecting and classifying disclination defects, smoothing and interpolating line data, and generating 3D visualizations for analysis. The current release is a beta version intended for early use, feedback, and bug discovery.

## Installation

Nematics3D is currently tested with Python 3.12. A dedicated virtual environment is recommended for installation.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/YingyouMa/Nematics3D.git
cd Nematics3D
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
```

If you prefer conda, you can create an environment first and then install the package with pip:

```bash
conda create -n Nematics3D python=3.12
conda activate Nematics3D
pip install .
```

You can verify the installation with:

```python
import Nematics3D
```

## Main Features

- Build `QFieldObject` instances from `Q` tensors or from `S` and `n`.
- Detect defects and classify them into disclination lines.
- Smooth and interpolate disclination-line geometry.
- Visualize disclination lines, scalar fields, and director fields in 3D.
- Plot local director or scalar structure on planes and cross-sections.

## Quick Start

The following example loads the sample `S` and `n` fields from `example/data`, builds a `QFieldObject`, smooths the detected disclination lines, and visualizes them:

```python
import numpy as np
import Nematics3D

n = np.load("example/data/n_example_global.npy")
S = np.load("example/data/S_example_global.npy")

Q = Nematics3D.QFieldObject(S=S, n=n, box_periodic_flag=True, name="testQ")
Q.act_lines_smooth()
Q.act_visualize_disclination_lines()
```
